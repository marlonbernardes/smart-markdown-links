# Markdown Link Editor Test File

This file contains various examples for testing the Markdown Link Editor extension.

## Basic Links

Here's a simple [link to Google](https://www.google.com) in a sentence.

Multiple links in one line: [First](https://example.com/1) and [Second](https://example.com/2).

## Link Variations

- Link with spaces in text: [My Example Site](https://example.com)
- Link with numbers: [Test 123](https://example.com/123)
- Link with special characters: [Test & Demo!](https://example.com/test)
- Link with longer URL: [Documentation](https://example.com/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section/docs/section)

## Edge Cases

- Link with underscores: [my_example_link](https://example.com/test)
- Link with parentheses: [Test (beta)](https://example.com/beta)
- Link at end of line: [End](https://example.com)
- [Link at start](https://example.com) of line
- Link with [nested [brackets]](https://example.com)

## Multi-line Content

This paragraph has a [very long link text that might wrap
to the next line](https://example.com) to test multi-line
behavior.

## Usage Instructions

1. Links are shown clean by default (only underlined text)
2. Click any link to expand it to full markdown
3. The link text is automatically selected
4. Edit text or URL as needed
5. Click outside to collapse back to clean view

Try creating a new link:
1. Type: `[`
2. Enter link text
3. Type: `](`
4. Enter URL
5. Type: `)`
6. Link automatically becomes clean when complete
