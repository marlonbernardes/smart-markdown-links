# Smart Markdown Links

A VS Code extension that enhances markdown link readability by showing only the link text while preserving the full markdown syntax. Click to expand and edit, click away to collapse.

## Key Features

- üîç Clean View: Shows only underlined link text, hiding markdown syntax
- ‚úèÔ∏è Click-to-Edit: Click any link to expand and edit in full markdown format
- üéØ Smart Selection: Automatically selects link text when expanded
- ‚å®Ô∏è Natural Typing: No interference when creating new links


## Usage

1. Open any markdown file in VS Code
2. Links in the format `[text](url)` will be displayed as underlined text
3. Click on any link to edit its URL
4. The link text remains unchanged while you can modify the URL

## Example

Instead of seeing:
```
[test](http://example.com)
```

You'll see:
<u>test</u> (underlined and clickable)
